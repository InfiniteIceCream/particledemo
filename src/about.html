<p>This is a gallery of animations I made in Khan Academy, which is where I learned about processing.js,
a Javascript library. I made this website with help from my dad, but I made the animations on my own.
When I made them, they were in processing.js, but when I made the website, I converted them to p5.js.
Some of them look a little different than they did in Khan Academy since I had some trouble converting
them. I got the CSS for the menu bar from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_navbar.asp">W3 Schools.</a></p>
<p>And here is some new text.</p>
